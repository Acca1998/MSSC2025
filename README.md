Welcome to the official GitHub repository of the MSSC2025 
(Modelling Solid State Chemistry) summer school! This repository contains all 
the necessary files, scripts, and resources that will be used during the 
tutorial sessions. MSSC2025 will be held in Torino, Italy in September, and it 
is designed to provide participants with hands-on experience in the field of 
solid-state chemistry modeling.

## About MSSC2025

The MSSC summer school is an annual event that focuses on the application of 
quantum-mechanical methods to the study of materials science. Topics covered in the
school include: basics of solid-state physics, density-functional theory, electronic 
structure of materials; use of local basis sets; spin-orbit coupling and magnetism; 
elasticity; lattice dynamics, vibrational spectroscopy (IR and Raman) and thermodynamics; 
transport properties; electron density analysis; parallel computing and response properties.

For more information about the event, please visit the MSSC2025 
[official webpage](https://mssc.crystalsolutions.eu).
