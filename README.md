Welcome to the official GitHub repository of the **MSSC2025** 
(*Ab Initio Modelling in Solid State Chemistry*) summer school! This repository contains all 
the necessary files, scripts, and resources that will be used during the 
tutorial sessions. MSSC2025 will be held in **Torino, Italy** in **September**, and it 
is designed to provide participants with hands-on experience in the field of 
solid-state chemistry modeling.

## ðŸ§ª About MSSC2025

quantum-mechanical methods to the study of materials science. Topics include:

- Basics of solid-state physics
- Density-functional theory
- Electronic structure of materials
- Use of local basis sets
- Spin-orbit coupling and magnetism
- Elasticity
- Lattice dynamics, vibrational spectroscopy (IR and Raman), thermodynamics
- Transport properties
- Electron density analysis
- Parallel computing and response properties
